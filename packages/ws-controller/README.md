# Open Home Foundation Matter(.js) Server - WebSocket Controller

![Matter Logo](https://github.com/matter-js/matterjs-server/raw/main/docs/matter_logo.svg)

This package implements the server-side WebSocket controller for the [OHF Matter Server](https://github.com/matter-js/matterjs-server/blob/main/README.md) project. It provides the Matter controller logic that handles WebSocket API requests from clients.

This package is used internally by the `matter-server` package. For building client applications that connect to the Matter Server, use the `@matter-server/ws-client` package instead.

The Open Home Foundation Matter Server software component is a project of the [Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/).
