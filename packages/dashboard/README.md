This package implements a web-based Dashboard for the [OHF Matter Server](https://github.com/matter-js/matterjs-server/blob/main/README.md) project. It is meant to be used for debugging and testing Matter devices.

The dashboard uses the `@matter-server/ws-client` package to connect to the Matter Server via WebSocket.

The Open Home Foundation Matter Server software component is a project of the [Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/).
